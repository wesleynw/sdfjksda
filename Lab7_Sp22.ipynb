In this lab, we will use our model from the previous lab to control S1XT33N's trajectory to be a straight line. We will do so in 2 different ways: open-loop control and closed-loop control. Of course, S1XT33N would be lacking if it could only drive in a straight line. In the next lab, we will address how to enable S1XT33N to turn within the controller we develop here. \n",

    "We will begin by exploring how to control our car using open-loop control. Open-loop control refers to a controller that does not take in feedback from the target system; it simply sets the inputs to what it calculates to be the proper values and lets the system run. For S1XT33N, open loop control takes the form of the Launchpad calculating the inputs $u_L$ and $u_R$ to set in order to have both wheels run at the same velocity v* (the operating velocity we calculated in the previous lab), setting its PWM output pins to those input values and then letting the motors run.\n",

    "**Note:** It's possible that the car curves *slightly* over long distances, even if it the car thinks it's traveling straight. This can be due to factors such as mechanical differences past the shaft of the motor, including slight variation in wheel size or wheel wobble, or encoder calibration issues. We can fix this later in the next part of the project. If you think this is happening for your car, ask a staff member to confirm for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips:**\n",
    " - Don't randomly guess on the f-values! This will take you a long time to find the ones that make your car drive straight. Your tuning should always be based off of the previous iterations' behavior; don't just randomly choose values. Try to be smart about how you change the f-values from iteration to iteration. If your car is turning to the left, think about how to change each f-value, either by increasing or decreasing its value, to fix it.\n",
    " - If you're trying to figure out whether to increase or decrease your f_left or f_right based off of your car's behavior, you can try setting the values to two opposite extremes (i.e. f_left = .9, f_right = .1 or f_left = .1, f_right = .9) and test it to see which one makes your car drive straighter.\n"

    "If delta doesn't converge to 0 but to some non-zero constant, this means that the car is driving straight, but not with the same bearing as you placed the car down with (i.e. the car has turned but drives straight eventually). However, we want the car to travel in (approximately) the same direction as when it starts moving. We can accomplish this by manually adding the known steady state error $\\delta_{ss}$ to each calculation of the error $\\delta$.\n",

After you have finished tuning your f-values, do the following:\n",
    "- Set `WRITE = 1` at the top of the `closed_loop.ino` program.\n",
    "- Upload the program, and press the leftmost button (2.1) when you are ready to run the car.\n",
